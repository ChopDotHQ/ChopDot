# Help & Support Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Approach:** Option A - Minimal, Non-Intrusive

## Overview

Implemented a clean FAQ-style help system accessible from the You tab. This provides onboarding support without interrupting the user experience.

## Components Created

### 1. `HelpSheet.tsx`
- **Location:** `/components/HelpSheet.tsx`
- **Design:** Clean iOS-style accordion with 10 FAQ items
- **Features:**
  - Smooth expand/collapse animations
  - Easy-to-scan Q&A format
  - Contact support CTA at bottom
  - Accessible via You tab

### 2. Updated `YouTab.tsx`
- **Added:** "Help & Support" button with pink accent icon
- **Position:** Between "Payment Methods" and "Notifications"
- **Action:** Opens HelpSheet modal on tap

## FAQ Content (10 Items)

1. **What is ChopDot?** - Core value proposition
2. **What are pots?** - Explain expense vs savings pots
3. **How do I add an expense?** - Basic usage
4. **What are attestations?** - Trust system explanation
5. **What are checkpoints?** - Pre-settlement verification
6. **How do I settle up?** - Settlement flow walkthrough
7. **What is DOT?** - Blockchain features (optional)
8. **How do savings pots work?** - DeFi yield explanation
9. **Can I use ChopDot without crypto?** - Reassure non-crypto users
10. **How do I invite someone?** - Adding members

## Design Decisions

### ✅ What We Did
- **Always accessible** - Help button in You tab
- **Non-intrusive** - User chooses when to access
- **Clear content** - Jargon-free, plain English
- **iOS-style accordion** - Familiar interaction pattern
- **Quick to scan** - Short answers, no walls of text

### ❌ What We Avoided
- No forced tutorial overlays
- No tooltips everywhere
- No carousel onboarding screens
- No achievement/gamification
- No complex state tracking

## User Flow

```
You Tab → Help & Support button → HelpSheet opens → Select question → Read answer
```

## Why This Works

1. **Respects user intelligence** - App is intuitive by design
2. **Help when needed** - Available but not forced
3. **Easy to maintain** - Single component, simple content
4. **Quick to implement** - 15 minutes total
5. **Scales well** - Easy to add more questions later

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add search functionality to FAQ
- Track most-viewed questions for insights
- Link to specific help articles
- Video tutorials (if needed)
- Context-sensitive help icons on complex screens

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing `BottomSheet` pattern (full-height modal)
- Leverages `Collapsible` component from shadcn/ui
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- Smooth animations via CSS transitions
- No external dependencies
