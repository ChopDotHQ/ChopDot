# Settlement Checkpoint System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Feature:** Ready to Settle Checkpoints

---

## Overview

Implemented a lightweight checkpoint system that ensures all pot members confirm they've entered their expenses before settlement calculations begin. This prevents premature settlements that could result in incorrect balances.

---

## Problem Solved

**Scenario:**
1. Alice wants to settle expenses in "Bali Trip 2025" pot on Oct 15
2. Bob settles with Alice for $150
3. On Oct 17, Charlie remembers he paid for hotel on Oct 10 and adds $600 expense
4. **Result:** Settlement distribution is now incorrect and they need to re-calculate

**Root Cause:** No mechanism to ensure everyone has finished entering expenses before calculating final balances.

---

## Solution: Just-in-Time Checkpoints

### Core Concept
When someone taps "Settle" in an expense pot, the system:
1. Creates a checkpoint asking all members: "Have you entered all your expenses?"
2. Shows confirmation status for each member
3. Allows settlement only when:
   - All members confirm, OR
   - User chooses "Settle Anyway" (bypass), OR
   - 48-hour auto-timeout expires

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Model

```typescript
interface ExpenseCheckpoint {
  id: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  status: "pending" | "confirmed" | "bypassed";
  confirmations: Map<string, { confirmed: boolean; confirmedAt?: string }>;
  expiresAt: string; // Auto-confirm after 48h
  bypassedBy?: string;
  bypassedAt?: string;
}

interface Pot {
  // ... existing fields
  checkpointEnabled?: boolean; // Default: true for expense pots
  currentCheckpoint?: ExpenseCheckpoint;
}
```

### 2. User Flows

**Flow A: Happy Path (All Confirm)**
```
1. Alice taps "Settle" → Checkpoint created
2. Bob confirms via CheckpointStatusScreen
3. Charlie confirms
4. Auto-proceeds to settlement
```

**Flow B: Bypass**
```
1. Alice taps "Settle" → Checkpoint created
2. Bob confirms
3. Charlie doesn't respond for 6 hours
4. Alice taps "Settle Anyway" → Proceeds with warning
```

**Flow C: Auto-Timeout**
```
1. Checkpoint created on Oct 15
2. Bob confirms, Charlie no response
3. Oct 17 (48h later): Charlie auto-confirmed
4. Notification sent → Settlement unlocked
```

**Flow D: Late Expense (Invalidation)**
```
1. Everyone confirms on Oct 15
2. Oct 16: Charlie adds new expense
3. Charlie's confirmation invalidated automatically
4. New confirmation request sent
```

---

## Components Created

### 1. CheckpointStatusScreen
**Location:** `/components/screens/CheckpointStatusScreen.tsx`

Full-screen modal showing:
- Progress indicator (e.g., "2/3 confirmed")
- Member confirmation status
- Time remaining until auto-confirm (48h)
- Actions:
  - "I'm Done" (confirm your expenses)
  - "Settle Anyway" (bypass checkpoint)
  - "Remind" (send notification to pending member)

**Design:**
- Clean iOS-style cards
- Green checkmarks for confirmed members
- Clock icon for pending members
- Pink accent for current user actions
- Auto-proceeds to settlement when all confirmed

---

### 2. Checkpoint Banner in PotHome
**Location:** Updated `/components/screens/PotHome.tsx`

Shows active checkpoint status:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 Settlement checkpoint active │
│ 2/3 members confirmed           │
│ View Status →                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Pink soft background (`var(--accent-pink-soft)`)
- Appears at top of pot detail screen
- Tappable to open CheckpointStatusScreen

---

## Core Functions

### Checkpoint Management

```typescript
// Create checkpoint when settling
const createCheckpoint = (potId: string) => {
  // Initialize confirmations for all members
  // Set 48h expiry
  // Return checkpoint object
}

// User confirms their expenses
const confirmCheckpoint = () => {
  // Mark current user as confirmed
  // Check if all confirmed
  // Update status
}

// Allow urgent settlement
const bypassCheckpoint = () => {
  // Mark checkpoint as bypassed
  // Record who bypassed and when
}

// Clean up after settlement
const clearCheckpoint = (potId: string) => {
  // Remove checkpoint from pot
}
```

### Auto-Invalidation

```typescript
// In addExpense() and updateExpense()
if (pot.currentCheckpoint?.confirmations.get("owner")?.confirmed) {
  // Invalidate user's confirmation if they add/edit expense
  // Prevents stale confirmations
}
```

---

## Settings Integration

Added toggle in Pot Settings (SettingsTab):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Settlement checkpoints          │
│ Confirm expenses before settling│
│                           [ON]  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Default: **ON** for expense pots
- OFF for savings pots (not applicable)
- User can disable per pot if needed

---

## Navigation Flow

```
PotHome → Tap "Settle"
  ↓
[Checkpoint enabled?]
  ↓ YES
CheckpointStatusScreen
  ↓
[All confirmed OR bypass?]
  ↓ YES
SettleSelection → SettleHome
  ↓ NO (checkpoints disabled)
SettleSelection → SettleHome
```

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Default Enabled
- All new expense pots have checkpoints ON by default
- Existing pots updated to enable checkpoints
- Savings pots: checkpoints N/A

### ✅ Smart Invalidation
- Adding expense after confirming → invalidates your confirmation
- Editing expense after confirming → invalidates your confirmation
- Prevents stale/outdated confirmations

### ✅ Flexible Bypass
- "Settle Anyway" button always available
- Warning message shown when bypassing
- Records who bypassed and when

### ✅ Auto-Timeout
- 48-hour countdown shown in UI
- Pending members auto-confirmed after timeout
- Prevents one inactive person from blocking settlement

### ✅ Clean iOS Design
- Matches ChopDot's 12pt radius, clean cards
- Pink accents for active states
- Progress indicators and status badges
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Member leaves pot:** Removed from checkpoint requirements
2. **Multiple pots:** Each pot has independent checkpoint
3. **Only 1 active checkpoint per pot:** Can't create duplicate
4. **Checkpoint + no expenses:** Member can confirm "zero expenses"
5. **Owner bypass:** Pot owner can always bypass checkpoint

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### Phase 2: Smart Features
- [ ] Checkpoint history/audit trail
- [ ] Proactive weekly expense reminders
- [ ] Smart defaults (auto-enable for trip pots)

### Phase 3: Notifications
- [ ] Push notifications for checkpoint requests
- [ ] Reminder notifications (24h before timeout)
- [ ] Email notifications for pending members

### Phase 4: Advanced
- [ ] Checkpoint analytics ("avg time to confirm")
- [ ] Checkpoint templates (monthly, trip-end, etc.)
- [ ] Member reliability tracking based on checkpoint responses

---

## Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `/App.tsx` - Added checkpoint state, functions, navigation
- `/nav.ts` - Added `checkpoint-status` screen type

### Components
- `/components/screens/CheckpointStatusScreen.tsx` - **NEW**
- `/components/screens/PotHome.tsx` - Added checkpoint banner
- `/components/screens/SettingsTab.tsx` - Added checkpoint toggle

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new expense pot → checkpoints enabled by default
- [x] Tap "Settle" → checkpoint screen appears
- [x] Confirm expenses → status updates
- [x] All members confirm → auto-proceeds to settlement
- [x] "Settle Anyway" → bypasses with warning
- [x] Add expense after confirming → invalidates confirmation
- [x] Edit expense after confirming → invalidates confirmation
- [x] Settings toggle → can disable checkpoints per pot
- [x] Checkpoint banner → appears in PotHome when active
- [x] Navigation → "View Status" opens checkpoint screen
- [x] Auto-timeout → 48h countdown shown

---

## Design Principles

1. **Lightweight:** Only activates when needed (on settle tap)
2. **Flexible:** Always allows bypass for urgent cases
3. **Smart:** Auto-invalidates stale confirmations
4. **Non-blocking:** Auto-timeout prevents indefinite blocking
5. **Clean UI:** Matches ChopDot's iOS-style design language

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented a **just-in-time checkpoint system** that ensures accurate settlements by confirming all expenses are entered before calculating final balances. The system is:
- Default enabled for expense pots
- User-configurable via settings
- Smart about invalidating stale confirmations
- Flexible with bypass options
- Non-blocking with auto-timeout

This prevents the common issue of premature settlements leading to incorrect distributions, while maintaining user agency and a clean, mobile-first UX.
