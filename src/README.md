## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: View in Figma Make (Fastest)
The prototype is currently running in Figma Make for rapid iteration.

1. Open the Figma Make preview
2. Check browser console for debug commands
3. Explore the app (all data is mock/localStorage)

### Option 2: Run Locally (Coming Soon)
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/chopdot.git
cd chopdot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Run with Backend (Docker)
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + API
docker-compose up -d

# See SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
```
