# Build & CI Sanity Report (MVP‑1)

> Generated by automated checks in the current environment.

### ✅ npm install summary
- First attempt (`npm ci || npm i`): ❌ Failed (exit code: 1)
- Error snippet:

```
npm error code ETARGET
npm error notarget No matching version found for y-webrtc@^10.6.3.
```

- Patch applied: updated `package.json` → `"y-webrtc": "^10.5.0"`.
- Second attempt (`npm i --no-audit --no-fund`): ❌ Failed with no stdout/stderr (likely environment install restrictions). Please run `npm ci` locally or enable networked installs in CI and re-run.

### 🧠 Type-check summary
- Command: `npm run type-check`
- Result: ❌ Failed (exit code: 127)
- Key output (first ~20 lines):

```
> chopdot@1.0.0 type-check
> tsc --noEmit

sh: tsc: not found
```

> Interpretation: TypeScript is not installed in this environment (likely because `npm install` didn’t complete). After installing deps, rerun.

### 🧹 Lint summary
- Command: `npm run lint`
- Result: ❌ Failed (exit code: 127)
- Key output (first ~20 lines):

```
> chopdot@1.0.0 lint
> eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0

sh: eslint: not found
```

> Interpretation: ESLint isn’t available because dependencies weren’t installed.

### 🏗️ Build summary
- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: ❌ Failed (exit code: 127)
- Key output (first ~20 lines):

```
> chopdot@1.0.0 build
> tsc && vite build

sh: tsc: not found
```

> Interpretation: Build toolchain (TypeScript/Vite) not present; run `npm install` first.

### 🚦 Overall verdict
**Blocking issues** — Dependency installation failed in this environment, which prevents type-check, lint, and build from running. No project source errors were reported because toolchain binaries were missing.

#### Blocking items and first error lines
- `npm i` → exit code 1 (ETARGET on y-webrtc, then silent due to environment restrictions)
- `npm run type-check` → `sh: tsc: not found`
- `npm run lint` → `sh: eslint: not found`
- `npm run build` → `sh: tsc: not found`

### Suggested next steps
1. Ensure networked install is allowed (e.g., run locally or enable network in CI):
   ```bash
   npm ci   # preferred in CI
   # or: npm install
   ```
2. Re-run:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```
3. If any new TypeScript/ESLint issues appear after install, share the logs and I’ll issue a follow‑up patch.
