# ChopDot Experience Workbench — Start Here

Always read `registry/progress.json` first. It is the canonical current-journey/count authority; historical prose does not override it.

## Shared process

Read `DESIGN_CONTRACT.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`, `shared/improvements.md`, then the current journey definition bundle and only relevant adjacent Goldens.

## Current authority

28 registered journeys; 22 Goldens; 6 remaining.

Journey 22 — QR Flows V1 is Golden #22. Exact approved artifact SHA-256: `3bbab5328a71d42866006c6f48088c06759fd0a3a922ee4a91e6fcd7bb75fe23`. Human approval is issue #38 comment `5639819516`; HTML changes after approval are not authorized.

Journey 23 — Import Data / Group V1 is **current at definition stage**. No J23 candidate or human approval exists.

## Preserve

All 22 Golden artifact checksums must pass. `registry/goldens.manifest.json` is generated and must not become competing approval authority. TYPO-01 remains deferred.

## Decision history

Each built journey's `spec.md#decision-history` records selected decisions, rationale, alternatives, tradeoffs, revisit triggers and source/approval references. Read it before changing a journey. Historical candidate labels do not override the current registry or approval records.

The 2026-09-06 backfill covers Journeys 01–14 from inspected records, not the complete conversation. Missing history is explicit. Author the section in the journey's `source/decision-history.md`; the gate preserves it through rebuilds. See `WORKFLOW.md#decision-history-and-future-revisits` and `registry/checkpoints/2026-09-06-decision-history.json`.
